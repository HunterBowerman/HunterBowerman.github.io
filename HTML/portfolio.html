                        I spend roughly between 4 to 6 hours a day practicing and pushing past the limits of my potential. 
                        I write and play what i make on my own. I have been told i have exponential speed and accuracy on the Guitar. 
                        The work i do within the time window of composing music is as follows: Writing in Tablature software, Programming and playing synthesizers, 
                        Recording and mixing harmonics and pieces of audio together, Finding the best tone and volume.

                        I program with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've been using the Windows OS since 2010. I started programming games with
                        C# for about a year 2017 - 2018. Then I started programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in July of 2022. This website
                        your lookimg at was all created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from me. I picked up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript very fast.
                        My favorite thing about programming is watching a empty project grow into something with full functionality!
                        My biggest strength is learning something new about what i'm programming and pushing the limits!
